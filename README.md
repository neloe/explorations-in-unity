## A set of notes during my messing with Unity while prepping for Game Dev

---

### Editors

* VS Community seems to suck; VS Code better/lighter?  Maybve not; need the .NET core 3.1 SDK and suggested extensions; let's see if that's nicer


### Scripting

* `GetComponent<T>` gets object that script is attached to
  * Script attached to many objects; script run independent on all objects?

### Components

* Constant Force 2D is a lie?  (seems to not be ma, but constant downward movement)

### Animation

* Drag animations to sprite
  * Create animation by selecting required sprites and dragging them to scene (simple animation, no keyframe)
